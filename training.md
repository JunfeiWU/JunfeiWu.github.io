## 2020-2021

### Retrieval of Snow Depth in Nam Co and Selin Co

Beijing, China

- Constructed field meteorological stations to collect snow depth and other relevant data. 
- Evaluated the accuracy of snow depth derived from passive microwave data and reanalysis datasets (ERA5, GLDAS, JRA55, MERRA2) in the study area. 
- Applied advanced machine learning techniques (random forest regression, support vector regression) for snow depth retrieval, replacing traditional linear regression methods.

## 2019

### Glacio-hydrological Modelling Using the Spatial Processes in Hydrological Model (SPHY)

Beijing, China
<br>
Trainers: [Prof. Arthur Lutz](https://www.futurewater.nl/wp-content/uploads/CV/CV_AFLutz2023-12en.pdf) and  [Dr. Sonu Khanal](https://www.futurewater.nl/wp-content/uploads/CV/CV_SKhanal_uk.pdf), FutureWater, The Netherlands


- Mastered the principles of a Python-based model through self-study after the training.
- Simulated surface runoff fluctuations across various spatiotemporal scales for the Selin Co and Nam Co regions.

## 2018

### Land Subsidence in Mountain-Cutting Areas: A Case Study from Lanzhou New District
Lanzhou, China
<br>
Mentor: *Prof. Guan Chen*

  - Compared the microstructures of soil samples from varying depths in both natural and mountain-cutting areas using a
  Scanning Electron Microscope.
  - Found that soil in mountain-cutting areas exhibited more structural damage and higher moisture content compared to
  natural areas, indicating a higher potential risk for subsidence.
