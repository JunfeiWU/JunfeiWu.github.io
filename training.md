14 - 18 Oct., Beijing, China

Trainers: [Prof. Arthur Lutz](https://www.futurewater.nl/wp-content/uploads/CV/CV_AFLutz2023-12en.pdf) and  [Dr. Sonu Khanal](https://www.futurewater.nl/wp-content/uploads/CV/CV_SKhanal_uk.pdf), FutureWater, The Netherlands


- Mastered the principles of a Python-based model through self-study after the training.
- Simulated surface runoff fluctuations across various spatiotemporal scales for the Selin Co and Nam Co regions.

### Land Subsidence in Lanzhou New Districtâ€™s Mountain-Cutting Areas

##### Undergraduate Research Assistant

College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University

Mentor: *Prof. Guan Chen*

  - Compared the microstructures of soil samples from varying depths in both natural and mountain-cutting areas using a
  Scanning Electron Microscope.
  - Found that soil in mountain-cutting areas exhibited more structural damage and higher moisture content compared to
  natural areas, indicating a higher potential risk for subsidence.
