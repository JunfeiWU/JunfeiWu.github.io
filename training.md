### Land Subsidence in Mountain-Cutting Areas: A Case Study from Lanzhou New District
Lanzhou, China
<br>
Mentor: *Prof. Guan Chen*

  - Compared the microstructures of soil samples from varying depths in both natural and mountain-cutting areas using a
  Scanning Electron Microscope.
  - Found that soil in mountain-cutting areas exhibited more structural damage and higher moisture content compared to
  natural areas, indicating a higher potential risk for subsidence.
