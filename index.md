# About Me

<img src="https://junfeiwu.github.io/junfei02.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Junfei Wu (Will, 邬俊飞)**.

I hold both a bachelor's and a master’s degree in physical geography from Lanzhou University, where I studied under Prof. Tandong Yao.

With over seven years of experience in physical geography, I have developed a strong expertise in climate change, remote sensing, hydrological modeling, and fieldwork, and have published two papers in these areas.

Currently, I work as a data product manager at DiDi Global, China’s largest online taxi booking company. While this role has provided valuable experience, I have realized that my true passion lies in academic research. I am now seeking a Ph.D. program to investigate how short-term environmental changes impact communities and individuals and to develop innovative solutions to enhance resilience.

For more information, please feel free to contact me at wujunfei5945@gmail.com. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my research interests further.
