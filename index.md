# About Me

<img src="https://junfeiwu.github.io/junfei02.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Junfei Wu (Will, 邬俊飞)**.

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Physical Geography from Lanzhou University, where I studied under the
supervision of Prof. Tandong Yao.

My research primarily focuses on climate change, avalanche formation, and snow-depth retrieval using remote sensing
techniques.

After graduating in 2022, I worked as a Data Product Manager at DiDi Global, China’s leading ride-hailing platform. In
this role, I was responsible for designing and optimizing a big data ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading)
software, leveraging customer behavior datasets.

However, after two years, I realized that my true passion lies in academic research. As a result, I resigned from my
position in November 2024 to pursue a Ph.D. program and further advance my academic and research aspirations.

For any further inquiries or information, please feel free to contact me at wujunfei5945@gmail.com.
