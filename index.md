# About Me

  Here is **Junfei Wu (Will, 邬俊飞)**. 

<img src="https://junfeiwu.github.io/junfei02.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

I graduated from Lanzhou University with both a bachelor's and a master's degree in physical geography, under the guidance of Prof. Tandong Yao. 

With over seven years of experience in physical geography, I've developed expertise in climate change, remote sensing, hydrological modeling, and fieldwork, and I’ve published two papers. 

Currently, I work as a data product manager at DiDi Global, China’s largest online taxi booking company. While this role has been valuable, I have discovered my true passion for academic research. I am now seeking a PhD program to explore how short-term environmental changes impact communities and individuals, and to develop innovative solutions for improving resilience.

If you’d like to know more about me, feel free to email me at wujunfei5945@gmail.com.  I would be delighted to communicate with you.
