# About Me

<img src="https://junfeiwu.github.io/junfei02.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Junfei Wu (Will, 邬俊飞)**.

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Physical Geography from Lanzhou University, where I studied under the
supervision of *[Prof. Tandong Yao](http://tdyao.itpcas.ac.cn/)*.

My academic background centers on hydrological modeling and snow-depth retrieval using remote sensing techniques.

After graduating in 2022, I joined DiDi Global, China’s leading ride-hailing platform, as a Data Product Manager. In
this role, I was responsible for designing and optimizing a large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) platform, and
working extensively with quantitative methods.

However, after three years in industry, I realized that my true passion lies in academic research. I resigned from my
position in 2025 to pursue a Ph.D., with the goal of deepening my expertise and contributing to cutting-edge
research in remote sensing or related fields where I can realize my full potential.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position. If you find my background aligns with your team, please
feel free to reach out to me at wujunfei5945@gmail.com. I’d be delighted to connect and discuss potential opportunities.
